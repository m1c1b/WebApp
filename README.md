I am forgot to add version tracking for some files and failed on revert commit.

So I decided to make a [**new repository**](https://github.com/m1c1b/WebAppFixed) where I **fixed** my mistake.

This one will exist for **the story**.

This is my university project. Windows Form is needed to enter values and generate values in Firebase.
By the click data is saved to a text file. WebApp is the app that display web page with animated graph.
